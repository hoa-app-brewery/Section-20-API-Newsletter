## About
This is a simple site with a sign up page to a mock newsletter using the Mailchimp API to handle the sign up requests. This project utilizes three static sites to respond to whether or not the sign up was succcessful. The project is hosted on heroku. This project was made to practice working with APIs and hosting apps on hosting services.

### Features

* Success and failure page to immediately inform users of sign up success
* API to handle sign up requests and automatically adds user to a mailing list
* Hosted live on a cloud service so app is accessible anywhere
